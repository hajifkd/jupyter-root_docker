# Docker container for MadGraph

[MadGraph](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) is a integrated event generator for the high energy phisics and
widely used in that field.

This docker image significantly simplifies the process to use MadGraph.

## Prerequisite

You need to install docker first. Check [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Install

```bash
docker pull hfukuda/madgraph
```

## Usage

This container uses model files in /var/UFO\_models and outputs in /var/MG\_outputs.

So you should indicate these folders like this:

```bash
docker run -t -i -v $HOME/models:/var/UFO_models -v $HOME/outputs:/var/MG_outputs hfukuda/madgraph
```

Note that the local path must be an absolute, not a relative one.

### Run madevent

To use madevent for a process named `PROC_NAME`, you can run

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/outputs:/var/MG_outputs -w /var/MG_outputs/PROC_NAME hfukuda/madgraph bin/madevent
```

### Run as the current user

By default, the madgraph run as root. If you want to run it as the current user, add `--user=$(id -u):$(id -g)` like this:

```bash
docker run -t -i --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) -v $HOME/models:/var/UFO_models -v $HOME/outputs:/var/MG_outputs hfukuda/madgraph
```

Note that `$HOME/outputs` must exist beforehand. Otherwise madgraph doesn't work well due to the permission problem.
